# MD simulations with Python
Adapted from https://github.com/klyshko/md_python/blob/master/Lecture.ipynb

The goal of this activity is to run a simple Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation of macromolecules. We will learn how to run these simulations using the Python programmming language. We will use the Python module `openmm`. Important concepts are also described in the notebook containing the activity:

- Newton's Laws
- Simulation of dynamics of particles
- Proteins and levels of their structure
- Molecular Mechanics
- MD simulations of proteins
